            My work history illustrates a pattern of stepping into unfamiliar roles,
            mastering the necessary skills, and driving impactful changes. Whether
            designing economic modeling frameworks at the IMF, becoming a trusted
            therapist for a professional athlete, or overhauling catering operations
            at a restaurant, I consistently demonstrate the ability to master new
            challenges and deliver high-value solutions.

            <p>Involvement in key projects</p>
            <p>"How can I be guaranteed to be involved in projects critical
                to the strategic future of this organization?"
            </p>
            <p>I actively seek opportunities to engage in work that drives the
                organization forward. Being a part of impactful, strategic projects
                ensures that my contributions align with the company's most important
                goals.

            <p>Outcomes over output</p>
            <p>"I focus on creating measurable outcomes, not just producing output,
                because driving meaningful behavioral change is the real key to
                business success."
            </p>
            <p>I prioritize delivering value and results that truly matter. By aligning
                work with customer needs and organizational goals, I ensure my efforts
                lead to meaningful, measurable success.

            <p>Everybody Sells</p>
            <p>"I believe that everyone in an organization contributes to selling
                by clarifying what we're building and understanding how it serves
                the customer.""
            </p>
            <p>I see every role as connected to the organization's mission of serving
                customers. By fostering clarity around the product and its value, I
                help ensure that the entire team aligns with customer needs and
                business success.
